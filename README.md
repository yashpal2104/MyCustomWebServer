# SingleThreadedWebServer
This is my first Single Threaded Web Server made using some of the Computer Science Fundamentals including Operating Systems and Computer Networking. Made in Java using Intellij Idea IDE code editor.

To make this work follow the below steps:
1. Set up the code with the help of any code editor I have used IntelliJ IDEA IDE making a {package} make a class of Server.java and Client.java and paste the code.
2. Go into pom.xml and ensure that you have all the necessary resources namely maven and java-jdk, showing you the Java version currently installed in your setup.
3. Main function to be declared.
4. Go into the terminal of your Operating System go into the directory where these files are located and compile with the help of the commands separately in different terminal windows:
   ```
   javac Server.java
   ```
   ```   
   javac Client.java
   ```
   
5. Now run the server and client in each terminal by entering these commands respectively:

   ``
